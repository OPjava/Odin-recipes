    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p style="width: 450px;">
        Koshri is another one of those genius solutions to using up pantry staples. It is a cousin to the Middle Eastern Mujadara. 
        In a nutshell, it is a comforting bowl of simple pantry staples: spiced lentils and rice, combined with chickpeas and small pasta.  
        All smothered in a tomato sauce that's been spiked with vinegar (out-of-this-world tasty, by the way!) Then…wait for it…it's topped with savory, crispy thin fried onion rings.
